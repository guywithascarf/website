            My favourite sport by far, I played football mainly in the <a href="https://sport.etoncollege.com/Fixtures_List.asp?Id=65&TID=1299442&SID=26">U15 Bs</a> this year. I hate to say that I've not scored many goals', but I play CDM, and am a tackling enthusiast.

            <h3>Basketball</h3>
            <br>
            I recently started playing this, and it has been very fun. A lot quiter than football and requires some speedy thinking. It's a great shame that it takes 20 minutes to get to the court!

            Books

    <p>
        It seems to me that I have been slacking on the literature side lately. Time to start reading:
    </p><div class="something">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>science fiction</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I recently read <em>Exhalation</em> (the collection, not the single story), and it really was quite a read. There are a lot of ideas in there that make you think.
                        It appears I shall be spending a lot of my time henceforth inside a library with a book in my hands - admittedly quite a good thing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <div class="books"><img src="Exhalation.jpg"></div>
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>fantasy</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I know, how childish. But it still is so enthralling when you find a good read with believable characters. <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em> was incredible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class="books"><img src="Wizard.jpg" /></div>
                    </li>

                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>philosophy</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I don't really know what to call this section, it's more just an opportunity for me to rant about books. <em>The Black Swan</em> just astonished me.
                        Even the very first chapter, the idea about how 9/11 could have been prevented by a legislator imposing continously locked bulletproof doors in every cockpit.
                        Yet if this really were to happen, 9/11 wouldn't have occured, but nobody would care because they never knew about it in the first place. Said legislator would've
                        been booted out of office due to the superfluity and high cost of his measure. I'm not too sure if this feeling is shared by anyone else, but it's pretty cool.
